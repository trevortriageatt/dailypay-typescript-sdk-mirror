      # DailyPay's API Versioning

      - Each API at DailyPay adheres to [semver standards](https://semver.org/) for versioning, represented as `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`:
        - The `MAJOR` version is incremented for breaking changes.
        - The `MINOR` version is incremented for backwards compatible changes.
        - The `PATCH` version is incremented for backwards compatible bug fixes.

      - DailyPay will issue a new major API version when a breaking change occurs.

      - To avoid breaking your code, developers are responsible for updating their API calls to interact with new versions of the DailyPay APIs.

      - Communication about API changes will be in the changelogs for the APIs or available from your DailyPay representatives.

      ## DailyPay views the following items as backwards compatible non-breaking changes:

      - New resources
      - New optional query parameters
      - New optional body properties on PATCH, POST, PUT
      - New properties on existing API responses
      - Property order changes on existing API responses
      - Changes to the content, length, or format of error messages and other human-readable strings

      ## Selecting the API Version

      Your API version controls the API behavior, properties in responses, available parameters in requests, and so on.

      If you want to use API version `v3` of the DailyPay Public REST API, specify the URL `https://api.dailypay.com/rest` or `https://api.dailypayuat.com/rest`.

      # Payment Flows

      ## Continuous Pay Access?

      Continuous Pay Access (formerly called Rolling Balance) allows a user to access earnings for a pay period that has already ended but has not yet been paid.

      **Consider the following definitions:**

      - `current pay period` - a pay period that has started but not yet ended
      - `unsettled pay period` - a pay period that has ended but has not yet had a payday
      - `settled pay period` - a pay period whose payday is today or prior

      While a pay period is unsettled, the employee has a percentage of their paycheck available for transfer ahead of payday. Once settled, any pay that was not transferred ahead of payday is deposited into an employee’s bank account and no longer available as Earned Wages.

      Earned Wage Access (EWA) is designed to maximize the available balance for each employee. The employee must have access to earnings from both the current and the unsettled pay period as both represent wages the employee has already earned.

      This is where the concept of continuous pay access comes into play. If continuous pay access is not enabled at a client, a user will not be able to access their earned wages between pay period end date and payday.

      ---

      ## Continuous Pay Access Example

      In this example, we have overlapping pay periods in July (7):

      - Continuous Pay Access Starts on 7/14 as `Pay Period 1` Ends and `Pay Period 2` Begins.
      - Continuous Pay Access Ends on 7/20 as `Pay Period 1` has settled, and only `Pay Period 2` funds are now available for transfer.

      ![Continuous Pay Access Example](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dp-devportal-images/pngs/ContinuousPayAccess/ContinuousPayAccessExample.png)

      ### Transfer Logic

      Transfers follow the "First In, First Out" logic. As such, transfers will be tied to Pay Period 1 until the earnings from Pay Period 1 have been exhausted.

      If earnings from Pay Period 1 are exhausted, transfers will be tied to Pay Period 2. This is determined by taking each pay period’s payday and sorting them in an ascending order.

      - With continuous pay access enabled, it is possible within Pay Period 2 to make a transfer that exclusively draws upon earnings from the unsettled Pay Period 1.

      - Continuous pay access also enables transfers spanning two pay periods. If a requested transfer amount exceeds what is available from Pay Period 1, the earnings to satisfy the transfer will span both pay periods. In effect, the user will be accessing earnings from both pay periods simultaneously with one transfer.

      ### DailyPay Public REST API Transfer Example

      The image below is an example transfer accessing earnings from both pay periods simultaneously with one transfer.

      - A user has two paychecks, `Paycheck 1` and `Paycheck 2` throughout two pay periods.
      - The user's first paycheck represents $100.00 of earnings, and the second paycheck represents $120.00 of earnings.
      - During the Continuous Pay Access Window, the user will have a total of $222.00 earned wages across two paychecks.
      - Assuming a 50% transfer rate, the user will have an Available Balance of $110.00 during the continuous pay access window.

  - name: Filtering
    description: |
      Efficiently retrieve DailyPay REST API resources with filtering queries by specifying query parameters in the request URL. This guide outlines how to build your queries.

      > The request URL for a filtered query is structured as follows:
      >
      > ```
      > https://dailypay.com/{endpoint}?filter={field}{operator}{value}
      > ```

      ## Terminology

      As mentioned above, filter queries are structured with _clauses_ - a _field_ coupled with an _operator_ and a _value_.
      Combine these clauses using _keywords_ for advanced filtering.

      - The `{endpoint}` is the resource you want to filter, such as [organizations](/tag/Organizations), [transfers](/tag/Transfers), or [paychecks](/tag/Paychecks).
      - A `{field}` is the attribute of a resource you want to filter by, such as a person's _name_ or a transfer's _status_.
      - An `{operator}` describes how filters should look up values, such as `:` for exact match or `~` for partial match.
      - A `{value}` is any value that could be a valid payload for the attribute, such as **"DailyPay"** for an organization name, or **"PROCESSING"** for a transfer status.

      ---

      ## Practical Examples

      ### Exact Match & Partial Match

      Filter for an organization with the exact name "DailyPay" (using the `:` operator) or any organization with "Daily" in the name (using the `~` operator).

      ```
      GET https://dailypay.com/organizations?filter=name:"DailyPay"
      GET https://dailypay.com/organizations?filter=name~"Daily"
      ```

      Exact matches can also include multiple comma-separated values (no whitespace), which will return matches for any of the values.

      ```
      GET https://dailypay.com/paychecks?filter=status:"IN_TRANSIT","PROCESSING","DEPOSITED"
      ```

      ### Escaping Characters

      `\` is used to escape quotes within strings.

      ```
      GET https://dailypay.com/organizations?filter=name:"The \"Daily Pay\" Company"
      ```

      ### AND & OR Clauses

      Together, `{field}{operator}{value}` form a clause. Clauses can be joined with `AND` or `OR` to form more complex filters.

      > Note that these keywords can be upper or lower case and `&` is also supported
      >
      > - `AND`, `and` or `&` are equivalent
      > - `OR`, `or` are equivalent

      ```
      GET https://dailypay.com/paychecks?filter=job_id:"12345" AND status:"PROCESSING"
      GET https://dailypay.com/paychecks?filter=job_id:"67890" OR status:"DEPOSITED"
      ```

      ---

      ### Parenthesis

      Parentheses are used to group expressions together and control the order of evaluation. By using parentheses, you can create complex filter conditions that combine multiple criteria clearly and unambiguously. Parentheses are useful for two main purposes:

      **1. Controlling Evaluation Order**

      Without parentheses, the filter conditions are evaluated from left to right. Using parentheses allows you to specify the evaluation order explicitly.

      ```
      GET https://dailypay.com/paychecks?filter=job_id:"aa860051-c411-4709-9685-c1b716df611b" AND (status:"DEPOSITED" OR status:"IN_TRANSIT")
      ```

      In this example, the API will retrieve paychecks whose status is "DEPOSITED" OR "IN_TRANSIT" belonging to the job of specified job_id. The parentheses ensure that the OR condition is evaluated first, and then the AND condition is applied to the result.

      **2. Nested Parenthesis**

      You can also use nested parentheses to create more complex filter conditions. By nesting parentheses, you can create intricate combinations of filtering criteria.

      ```
      GET https://dailypay.com/paychecks?filter=((status:"IN_TRANSIT" OR status:"PROCESSING") AND (job_id:"aa860051-c411-4709-9685-c1b716df611b" OR job_id:"ta123051-c611-4710-9687-c1b716jld32"))
      ```

      In this example, the API will retrieve all paychecks with either an IN_TRANSIT or PROCESSING status and belonging to either of the two specified job_ids.

      See a complete list of fields and operators for each endpoint below.

      ## API Troubleshooting Guide

      If you are experiencing issues or encountering errors while using the API endpoints for on-demand pay functionality, refer to the following troubleshooting steps:

      1. **Verify API Endpoint Access:**
         - Ensure that you are using the correct Base URL for accessing the API endpoints. Double-check the appropriate base URL and endpoint paths:
           - Production: `https://api.dailypay.com/rest`
           - UAT: `https://api.dailypayuat.com/rest`

         For API calls made from the developer portal to the DailyPay UAT environment:
         - Ensure you have a UAT API key.
         - Scrub any data containing employee phone, email, and direct deposit information.
         - Use non-production data.

      2. **Check Authentication and Authorization:**
         - Confirm that you are providing the correct authentication credentials to access protected API resources.
         - Verify that the access token is valid and has the necessary permissions for the desired actions.

         Refer to the [Authentication Overview](Authentication) guide for assistance in confirming these details.

      3. **Review Endpoint Parameters:**

         See the [endpoint references](Getting-Started) with examples listed under relevant categories, e.g., _Users_ or _Organizations_.

      4. **Handle Response Codes and Error Messages:**
         - Pay attention to the response codes returned by the API. HTTP status codes in the 2xx range generally indicate success, while codes in the 4xx or 5xx range indicate errors.
         - Refer to the API documentation for a comprehensive list of error codes and their meanings. Error messages returned by the API can provide valuable insights into the cause of the issue.

         Error codes and their meanings are included under each endpoint description.

      5. **Test in the Sandbox Environment:**
         - Test your integration in the sandbox environment to troubleshoot and debug without affecting live production data. Refer to the [environments setup guide](tag/Getting-Started#section/Environments) for assistance.

      6. **Logging and Error Tracking:**
         - Implement logging mechanisms in your application to capture relevant information, such as request and response details, error messages, and stack traces.
         - Use proper error tracking tools or services to centralize and monitor error occurrences. This can help identify patterns and provide insights for resolution.

      7. **Reach Out to Developer Support:**
         - If you have exhausted the troubleshooting steps and are still unable to resolve the issue, reach out to the developer support team for assistance.
         - Provide detailed information about the problem, including the API endpoints, request parameters, and any error messages received.

      Remember, troubleshooting steps may vary depending on the specific API endpoints and implementation details. Consult the [DailyPay Public REST API documentation](REST-API-Introduction), error code references, and support resources provided by the API provider for further guidance and assistance in resolving any issues you encounter.

              An employer represents an organization that uses the integrated workforce management system. Employers can often manage employee profiles, approve on-demand pay requests, generate payroll reports, monitor workforce analytics, and configure pay cycles and schedules. The REST API empowers employers to streamline workforce management tasks and efficiently handle employee compensation and administration.

                The API leverages OAuth 2.0 for authentication. To interact with user-based operations that require an individual's consent, you'll need to obtain access tokens using the authorization grant flow. For non-user-specific operations that involve accessing endpoints such as 'organization search', you will utilize client credentials for authentication.

      # DailyPay API Access

      ---

      DailyPay adheres to the [OAuth 2.0 RFC 6749](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749) and [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) specifications. This document will walk you through the steps to get an _access token_ your application can use to make requests to the DailyPay Public REST API.

      We support the following methods:

      - [Authorization Code Flow](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-4.1): This method is suitable when access to resources requires user consent, such as bank account information or the ability to initiate transfers on behalf of the user.

        > It allows your application to get `access` and `refresh` tokens, facilitating user consent and enabling your application to perform actions on their behalf.

      - [Client Credential Flow](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-4.4): This method is suitable for server-to-server operations, where additional levels of user consent may not be required.
        > The client credentials grant facilitates the acquisition of an access token independent of a user's protected resources. For instance, you can utilize [the _Organizations_ endpoint](/tag/v3/Organizations#operation/readOrganization).

      # Authorization Code Flow

      The purpose of following the OAuth2 flow is to help you retrieve an authorization <strong><code>code</code></strong>
      and exchange it for an <strong><code>access_token</code></strong> via the <a href="/tag/Authentication#operation/requestOauthAccessToken">request access token</a> endpoint.

      ## 1. Register your Application

      Your DailyPay contact will ask you to provide

      - a callback url that can receive the <strong><code>code</code></strong> result of the OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow
      - links to your privacy policy and terms of service
      - optionally, a logo for use on the OAuth consent screen

      <details>
      <summary>OpenID Connect (OIDC)</summary>

      - For additional security, you may be asked to provide DailyPay with a JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) or url for retrieving your JWKS to utilize signed <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#JWTRequests">OIDC requests</a>.</p>
      </details>

      ## 2. Configure

      <p>DailyPay will provide configuration values for your application:</p>
      <ul>
          <li><code>client_id</code></li>
          <li><code>client_secret</code>, if applicable</li>
          <li><code>scope</code>a list of scopes your application can request, which may include "offline_access" and "openid"</li>
          <li><code>redirect_uri</code> the registered callback url you provided</li>
      </ul>

      You may wish to use a client library (https://oauth.net/code/) to perform the next steps, using the configuration values above.

      ## 3. Initiate an OAuth2 request

      Construct the request url using the template below, replacing the <strong><code>{scope}</code></strong>, <strong><code>{client_id}</code></strong>, and <strong><code>{redirect_uri}</code></strong> parameters with the configuration values accordingly.

      Additionally, generate a <strong><code>state</code></strong> parameter for the specific request, and a code challenge and verifier (used in a later step) for <a href="https://oauth.net/2/pkce/">Proof Key Code Exchange</a>.

        <pre><code>https://auth.dailypay.com/oauth2/auth
          ?response_type=code
          &scope={scope}
          &client_id={client_id}
          &redirect_uri={redirect_uri}
          &state={state}
          &code_challenge={code_challenge}
          &code_challenge_method=S256
        </code></pre>

        <details>
        <summary>Example</summary>
        
        <pre><code>https://auth.dailypay.com/oauth2/auth
          ?response_type=code
          &scope=user%3aread_write%20openid
          &client_id=your-client-id
          &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fcallback
          &state=9876543fghijklm
          &code_challenge=hKpKupTM391pE10xfQiorMxXarRKAHRhTfH_xkGf7U4
          &code_challenge_method=S256
        </code></pre>
        
        Make sure to url-encode each parameter e.g. <code>user:read_write</code> becomes <code>user%3aread_write</code>
        </details>
        <br>

      ## 4. Open a browser window, tab, or secure mobile view to the constructed URL.

      The user will be prompted to log in or create a new DailyPay account and will be prompted to allow your application to act on their behalf.

      <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dp-devportal-images/pngs/OAuthAllowFlow.png">

      ## 5. Handle the code

      Users will be redirected in the open tab to your callback url with a `code` query parameter,
      or an `error` and `error_description` if the user did not consent to your application's request or otherwise encountered an error.
      You will also be returned the `state` parameter.

      ## 6. Exchange the code for an Access Token

      As also specified in our [token endpoint documentation](Authentication#operation/requestToken),
      send the following parameters www-form-encoded in the request body to https://auth.dailypay.com/oauth2/token.

      <table>
      <thead>
      <tr>
      <th>Parameter</th>
      <th>Required</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
      <tr>
      <td>grant_type</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>Must be set to <code>authorization_code</code>.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td>client_id</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>Your client id provided by DailyPay.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td>code</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>The authorization code received from the authorization server.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td>redirect_uri</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>MUST be the redirection URI used in the initial authorization request.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td>client_secret</td>
      <td>Varies</td>
      <td>Your client secret, if provided by DailyPay.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td>code_verifier</td>
      <td>Varies</td>
      <td>The PKCE verifier matching the code_challenge generated earlier.</td>
      </tr>
      </tbody>
      </table>

      Example Request to the Token Endpoint

      <pre><code>curl --request POST \
          --url https://auth.dailypay.com/oauth2/token \
          --header 'accept: application/json' \
          --header 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \

  - name: Client Portal
    description: |
      The client portal is a tool that enables you to effectively manage users as you build and test your DailyPay API integration. The portal provides access to upload, download, and track data exchanges for files like user rosters, gross and net earnings, and allows for admin management.

      ![ProviderPortalOverview](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dp-devportal-images/pngs/provider_portal_guide/provider_portal_overview.png)

      This page will provide an overview of the following high-level metrics:

      - **Dollars Transferred** from DailyPay to employees in the past 7 days
      - **Gross Earnings** Reported for all users in the past 24 hours
      - **Enrollment** of eligible Users (% of employees enrolled in the DailyPay Program)
      - **Adoption** % of eligible users (% of eligible employees that have made 2 or more transfers with DailyPay)

      It also calls attention to important action items related to the Data Exchange (for example, if updates to employee direct deposit information are needed). You will have quick access to the following manual tasks:

      - Download Direct Deposit Updates
      - Upload the most recent Gross Earnings, Net Earnings (Payroll Journal), and User Roster Files

      > The Search Bar at the top of the screen allows you to locate employee accounts by name or User ID #.

      ---

      # User Tab

      ![ProviderPortalUserTab](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dp-devportal-images/pngs/provider_portal_guide/provider_portal_user_tab.png)
      Here you can see how many employees are enrolled, how many have yet to enroll, and how many
      have a canceled status. By using the top search bar, you can also locate employee accounts by name or User ID #, or you can filter the employees based on status or pay group. Below are the different user statuses:

      - **Active**: An employee who has enrolled in DailyPay, but may or may not have made a transfer yet.
      - **Canceled**: Users who have opted out of DailyPay or a user who has been terminated.
      - **Pending**: DailyPay has created accounts for these users, but they have not yet completed the enrollment.
      - **Review**: User who signed up for the DailyPay Program but may require actions before moving to the Active status.

      Below are some _Review_ examples:

      - The user enters an invalid bank account, and the DailyPay support team will work directly with the employee to resolve the issue. (Most Common)
      - The user changed their details like first and last name, email or phone number, and the support team needs to review and reconfirm updates with the user.
      - Unusual user activity, such as fraud or frequent cancelation/reactivation.
      - Client-reported accounting or timekeeping issues.

      ## Users Tab: What information can be seen for each employee

      ![WhatEachEmployeeSees](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dp-devportal-images/pngs/provider_portal_guide/provider_portal_whatEmployeeSees.png)

      - **General Information** such as Contact information and User ID.
      - **Banking**:
        - You can see which DailyPay account is on file in your payroll system.
        - You can see which Bank account is on file in the user’s DailyPay Account
          Settings as their primary account (where they would like to receive their
          paycheck on payday).

      > You will also have the ability to report an employee termination and/or disable their DailyPay account.

      - To report an employee termination, click _Report Termination_ and then indicate how the employee will receive the final paycheck.

      ![ReportTermination](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dp-devportal-images/pngs/provider_portal_guide/provider_portal_report_termination.png)

      - **No Change** (final pay only through direct deposit to DailyPay account):
        - If an employee will be paid via direct deposit, choose this option, regardless if the final paycheck is sent off-cycle or on payday.
      - **Paper Check** (deductions allowed with invoice request from DailyPay):
        - If the employee is in a state that allows “wage discounting” and will be paid via paper check, choose this option.
        - You’ll be prompted to enter the termed employee’s final net pay amount (according to their payroll system), and the portal will return the outstanding DailyPay transfers (amount owed), and the dollar amount that should be given on the final paper check.
        - You then have the option of the remittance to DailyPay, either an invoice or through the DailyPay Account via direct deposit.
      - **Paper Check** (no deductions allowed):
        - If an employee must receive full pay immediately via paper check only, choose this option. DailyPay will work with the user to recoup the outstanding balance.
      - If you’d like to disable a user, please click **Disable Account**.

      ## User Statements

      Within the User’s Account, you will also have the option to view the employee’s _Statements_

      payment information:

      - The employee's full paycheck, and which amount was transferred before payday
        and received on payday.
      - All DailyPay transfers the user took within the pay period when they occurred, what
        type of transfer it was (instant vs. next-day ACH), fees, and which account the
        payment was transferred to.
      - All payments the user received from the client.

      ## What is the Payments API?

      The Payments API is a PCI compliant endpoint and allows for secure debit card token creation. These tokens are used within DailyPay's APIs. When a tokenized debit card is added to a user’s account they can begin to take instant transfers.

      **How does this work?** A user's debit card data is sent via POST request to the Payments API. The debit card data is encrypted and tokenized before being returned. This tokenized card data is used for instant transfers via the Extend API.

      ### What is PCI compliance?

      It’s how we keep card data secure. DailyPay has a responsibility and legal requirement to protect debit card data therefore the Payments API endpoint complies with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards [PCI DSS](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/).

      > 📘 **Info**
      > DailyPay only handles card data during encryption and tokenization
      > **The Payments server is DailyPay’s only PCI compliant API.**

      ## Create a Debit Card Token

      Steps to create a tokenized debit card for use within DailyPay's APIs.

      ### 1. POST debit card data to the Payments API

      After you have securely collected the debit card data for a user, create a POST to the PCI compliant payments endpoint [`POST Generic Card`](/v2/tag/Card-Creation) with the following required parameters in this example.

      ```json
      {
        "first_name": "Edith",
        "last_name": "Clarke",
        "card_number": "4007589999999912",
        "expiration_year": "2027",
        "expiration_month": "02",
        "cvv": "123",
        "address_line_one": "1234 Street",
        "address_city": "Fort Lee",
        "address_state": "NJ",
        "address_zip_code": "07237",
        "address_country": "US"
      }
      ```

      ### 2. Receive and handle the tokenized card data

      The [payments endpoint](https://developer.dailypay.com/v2/reference/post_cards-generic) returns an opaque string representing the card details. This token is encrypted and complies with PCI DSS. You will need the token for step 3, after which it can be discarded. The token is a long string and will look similar to below:

      ```json
      {"token":"eyJhbGciOiJSU0Et.....T0FFU”}
      ```

      ### 3. POST the token to the Extend API

      > 📘 **Important** > [Proper authorization](/v2/tag/Authorization) is required to create a transfer account.

      Send the encrypted token in a POST request to the [transfer accounts endpoint](/v2/tag/Users#operation/createTransferAccount) as the value for the `generic_token` field. This will create a transfer account and allow a user to start taking transfers.

      The _health_ endpoint provides a simple health check for the API. 

      **Functionality:** Check the status of the API to ensure it is functioning
      correctly.

                **Special note for earnings_balance-type accounts:**
                During a typical pay period, if a user transfers no money from an earnings_balance-type account to a personal account, 
                the `current` balance will generally be 0, because transfers from earnings to this account will be 
                PENDING until the paycheck related to those earnings is processed. 
                Pending inflows are included in the `available` balance, not the `current` balance.
                 
                If a user transfers money from an earnings_balance-type account to a personal account, 
                the `current` balance will be negative as those transfers settle. When a paycheck is processed, 
                DailyPay will automatically attempt to zero out the balance, 
                transferring any remaining funds to the `default_paycheck_destination` set for the associated Job.

                If DailyPay is unable to zero out the balance during paycheck processing, the `current` balance will remain negative, 
                which may impact a user's ability to transfer additional funds from their earnings balance. 
                In those cases, the available balance will be 0.
